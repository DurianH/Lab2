            I'm actually so glad that I only have one class on Friday's. I screwed up my sleep schedule and I woke up so late that I'd probably miss any class that I had in
            the morning. So luckily that one class is in the mid-afternoon. I'm not really in the mood to catch up on yesterday's lectures because today feels like a lazy
            day, so I'm going to push that off for the weekend.

            I've spent a good amount of time chilling today. Unfortunately I wasn't as productive as I would like to have been, but that's okay. I'm hoping that as the quarter
            goes on I'll be able to get into my groove.

            One of the surprise things to happened today was that Anthony had his comeback stream without me knowing,
            so I started moderating a little late to his stream heh. Here's his channel in case you ever want to
            drop on by and say <i>"Hello"</i> to my friend or me: https://www.twitch.tv/GrimmerRavenn

                To be quite frank he hasn't been streaming lately and he's been streaming content on custom mechanical keyboards so hopefully you can enjoy the stream. And maybe
                just maybe, we can get you to also go down the rabbit hole of mechanical keyboards.

            Homework that I need to get done today:
            <ol>
                <li>CSE 110 Week 2 Review Quiz</li>
                <li>CSE 110 Lab 2</li>
                <li>CSE 142 Lab 1</li>
            </ol>

            As of typing these words, I am having such a <i>fun</i> time figuring out how to add videos into this jounral. :) I'm not quite sure as to where I can 
            find MP4 videos straight up, so I'm just going to snatch one from a tutorial website to make life easier because the tutorials that I find aren't helping
            me out with the video tag and I don't know where else to get MP4 videos since I couldn't get YouTube to work. I will also be reusing the same video for the
            audio portion to make that easier as well.
